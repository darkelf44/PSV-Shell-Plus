# PSVshell+

This is a fork of PSVshell, called PSVshell+. It adds a number of extra features,  mostly for PS TV owners
(like myself), but others can find it useful too.

## Extra features

- Swap the cross and cirle buttons for playing japanese games
- Disable L3 and R3 (the stick buttons) to precent you from accidentally pressing them.
- DS4 touchpad emulation. This has three modes:
  - **front:** Use the thouchpad to emulate the front touchscreen
  - **F/B:** Emulated both the front and the back thouchpad, usign the touchpad button to toggle between them
  - **F/B/X:** Same as "F/B", but it toggles between front, back and off, not just front and back.
- DS4 motion emulation. This has two modes:
  - **normal:** The DS4 controller has the same orientation as the Vita.
  - **vertical:** The DS4 held horizontally has the orientation of the Vita held vertically.

- Press **X** to toggle frequency mode for currently selected **> device <**:
  - **Default freq.** (WHITE) - the plugin will not interfere, but rather use the default freq. for current game

    - press **LEFT/RIGHT** to immediately change the frequency
- Press **X** when **> save profile <** is selected to save/delete profiles
  - All **Manual freq.** (BLUE) will be loaded and applied next time you start/resume the game
